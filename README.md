# UGKSFlux
## Flux function of unified gas-kinetic scheme for 1D and 2D cases
The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is a numerical solver of kinetic-type (Boltzmann) equations. Despite the demo program given in https://github.com/vavrines/UGKS, sometimes you just want to omit the details of implementation and directly use the algorithm. This repo serves that goal, where two Fortran90 modules are provided with 1D/2D UGKS fluxes implemented into two subroutines. Direct call of the subroutines is enabled.
